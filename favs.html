            These movies are some of my favorites of all time. This list changes a lot for me as I 
            watch more movies and my tastes change but this is what I could come up with for now. Many of
            these movies are crime thrillers because that is probably my favorite genre currently but I tried 
            to include as many genres as possible.

            <p>This movie was my favorite for a while in middle school. Heath Ledger as the Joker is probably one of the most
                memorable characters in a movie of all time. Lots of action in the movie and a good watch if you're in the mood for an action movie.

            <p>Watched this movie for the first time very recently. The movie is a good story of hope and determination. A good movie to watch if your in the mood to watch a classic crime/ thriller movie.</p>

            <p>I've never been a fan of horror movies but this one is a lot different from the typical horror movie you
                see with lots of jumpscares. This movie is very creepy but if you can get past the creepyness and enjoy the character of
                Hannibal Lector it is a very enjoyable movie to watch.

            <p>I've always been a fan of movies about organized crime and the Mafia. This one is a very good
                representation of the Mafia in the 1900s around the time that the war on drugs started. This movie
                is pretty violent so you probably shouldn't watch it if that's not your thing. But if you are a fan of 
                crime movies this is a great one to watch.

                It is the dream of many kids to be a secret agent like James Bond one day. I have always enjoyed watching
                James Bond movies and this one is my favorite partly due to the fact that they play high stakes poker in it.
                This movie is a good one to watch if you are the mood to see a cool guy narrowly escaping death about 10 times
                throughout 2 hours.

            <p>Quentin Tarantino is one of the most famous modern directors and this is the widely considered 
                the best of his films. This movie is one of the most quotable movies that you can watch, and Samuel
                L Jackson character of Jules Winfeld is one of the coolest. This movie is a good watch if you're in the mood
                for a crime thriller.

                This movie is widely considered one of the greatest of all time. I watched this movie
                after reading the book in high school and it quickly became one of my favorites. The story
                of the Don and Michael Corleone is a very interesting and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The 
                plot may move slowly at some points but the overall story makes it a great watch for anyone 
                who is in to crime movies.

                Going into this movie I did not expect to enjoy it that much because it is a movie about
                a drummer in a jazz band which did not seem interesting to me. But after watching it, it quickly became 
                one of my favorites. The relationship between Miles Teller as Nieman and his director was very intense and
                the way the story is depicted I would consider this movie close to perfect. If you are in the mood for an intense
                movie with a lot of emotion this is a great one.

                If you are a fan of Leonardo Dicaprio this is a great movie to watch. Seeing him on the 
                run from the FBI as Frank Abagnale Jr keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole movie.
                What makes this movie great is hwo interesting the character of Frank Abagnale Jr is.
